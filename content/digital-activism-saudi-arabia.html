                SELF DESTRUCTION OF DIGITAL ACTIVISM IN SAUDI
                ARABIA</h1>
                <p>Activism is difficult, but present, in one of the
                most repressed countries in the world. The Saudi Arabian
                regime tightly controls expression and harshly punishes
                dissent. This is one of the reasons the regime survived
                the Arab Spring of 2011, which toppled many
                authoritarian governments in the Middle East but barely
                manifested in Saudi Arabia. Nevertheless, activism lives
                on in the country. The different Saudi activist
                movements have been tied to the communication media of
                the time. Activists used speech, radio, satellite
                television, and lately, the internet to communicate,
                organize, spread ideologies, and mobilize support.
                Despite increasing the ability for activists to spread
                ideas, internet adoption has harmed activism in Saudi
                Arabia because it enabled the state to further repress
                dissent, and it replaced communities where activism
                originally thrived.</p>
                <h2 id="the-reach-of-the-internet">THE REACH OF THE
                INTERNET</h2>
                <p>Activists have utilized the internet to spread
                messages and mobilize support more effectively than
                previous mediums. In the last decade, activist movements
                in Saudi Arabia adopted the internet as their primary
                mode of communication.<a href="#fn1"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Activists use social
                media and other internet services to express dissent,
                spread their ideology, and organize movements and
                uprisings. State repression has been unable to stop
                online activism, as instances of the state arresting
                well-known dissidents resulted in more online dissent
                rather than silence.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> However,
                this increase in online activism has not been enough to
                overcome the barriers to meaningful change in Saudi
                Arabia. Major uprisings before and after the transition
                to the internet have had similar outcomes. In 1979, the
                long-oppressed Saudi Shi’a minority organized an
                uprising in Qatif. Inspired by the success of the
                Iranian revolution and the radio broadcasts from the
                post-revolutionary government, as well by pamphlets
                distributed by the Organization for the Islamic
                Revolution in the Arabian Peninsula, thousands of Shi’a
                took to the streets demanding change. Within days, the
                uprising had turned violent, and the national guard
                swiftly quashed it with deadly force. This effectively
                ended the uprising, and despite occasional flareups of
                unrest in the subsequent months, the uprising did not
                reignite or successfully spread to other regions.<a
                href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> However, with only
                access to radio, printed pamphlets, and speech, the
                Shi’a of Qatif were able to organize one of the largest
                uprisings in modern Saudi Arabia. In the Saudi uprisings
                of 2011, the activists relied upon the internet. Once
                again, the Shi’a living around Qatif organized the
                uprising. This time, inspired by the Arab Spring and
                increased online activism, organizers on Facebook called
                for a Day of Rage. This began protests that lasted for
                months. Videos shared online of state security gunning
                down protestors propelled the protests. But eventually
                heavy police retaliation overwhelmed the protestors and
                stopped them before the uprising could spread to other
                regions.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Even though
                protestors utilized the internet to organize and gain
                international attention, the outcome was similar to the
                uprising of 1979. Internet activism was not enough to
                meaningfully change the outcome of an uprising in Saudi
                Arabia. Additionally, during the protests, dozens of
                activists were arrested for spreading messages online
                without physically participating in the protests.
                Dr. Yusuf al-Ahmad was one such detainee—a cleric who
                was arrested for tweeting support for the protestors’
                cause.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The transparency of
                the internet enabled the state to track and silence the
                thought leaders, not just the people who participated in
                riots. The benefits of the internet were not enough to
                overcome the state’s crackdown, and the nature of the
                medium enabled even more repression.</p>
                <h2 id="state-repression">STATE REPRESSION</h2>
                <p>The Saudi state has extensive control over the
                internet, which limits the spread of activist messaging
                and enables the state to surveil activists’ online
                activity. Saudi Arabia has one of the most censored
                internets in the world, online speech that is critical
                of the government is punishable by death, and a lack of
                privacy laws allows the government to spy on the web
                traffic of domestic internet users.<a href="#fn6"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Previous forms of
                media that activists used were not as controllable. In
                the 1950s and 60s, a Marxist movement was growing among
                Saudi Aramco workers. Teachers employed by Aramco,
                Marxist pamphlets, and radio broadcasts exposed workers
                to the political philosophy. Particularly, workers
                listened to Radio Moscow, which had good reception in
                the Gulf, and Sawt al-’Arab, Nasser’s radio program
                which preached Arab unity and socialism.<a href="#fn7"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The Saudi state
                could not touch either of these broadcasts, as they were
                located in other countries. There is no way to block a
                radio frequency, and listening to a radio broadcast is
                anonymous, so activists had full, unrestricted access to
                revolutionary ideas. However, the state can and does
                block information on the internet and surveil the web
                traffic of Saudis who access dissident content. The
                state is even able to spy on dissidents in other
                countries. In 2018, the Saudi regime murdered Jamal
                Khashoggi, a journalist and well-known dissident, when
                he entered their consulate in Istanbul to obtain
                marriage papers. Journalists have found evidence that
                the Saudis hacked Khashoggi’s phone and installed
                Israeli-made spyware, which enabled them to see
                Khashoggi’s activity and know when he would enter the
                consulate.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Saud
                Al-Qahtani, a close advisor to crown prince Mohammed bin
                Salman, ordered Khashoggi’s murder and watched it over a
                skype call. Al-Qahtani allegedly heads the Saudi’s
                hacking and foreign surveillance efforts. Independent
                investigators have found a trail of Al-Qahtani’s
                internet activity and determined that he has attempted
                to purchase spyware from foreign groups, registered
                domains meant to spread malware, and targeted spyware at
                dissidents in and outside of Saudi Arabia.<a href="#fn9"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> This means that
                activists are never safe when expressing dissent online,
                even after fleeing to another country. By using the
                internet, activists are committing crimes that are
                punishable by death on a medium that the government
                fully controls. But government intervention is not the
                only reason the internet is a worse medium for activism.
                The decentralized nature of online movements has
                restructured activist organizations in ways that will
                eventually make them falter. </p>
                <h2 id="the-destruction-of-community">THE DESTRUCTION OF
                COMMUNITY</h2>
                <p>The internet has replaced communities that were
                originally the heart of activist movements. A prominent
                activist movement that has been developing in Saudi
                Arabia for decades is the Sahwa, or the Islamic
                Awakening. Activist-established organizations were the
                backbone of the Sahwa, as they introduced young people
                to the movement and kept them engaged. The strongest of
                these organizations was the state’s own educational
                institutions. Upon creation of the state’s education
                system, administrators picked members of the Muslim
                Brotherhood as faculty because they often had college
                educations from the countries they had been exiled from.
                Muslim Brothers ended up comprising the majority of the
                faculty for many of the nation’s universities and
                secondary schools. This resulted in a wide-spread,
                Islamist influence on the curricula.<a href="#fn10"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> This exposed entire
                generations of young Saudis to Sahwa thinking and
                reinforced the ideology through the influence of their
                teachers. Certain programs were aimed at younger
                students, specifically the Qur’an memorization circles
                and activities planned by teachers that imparted
                Islamist principles.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> The
                education system exposed young activists to the Sahwa,
                but their involvement was maintained by many
                organizations. Camps kept students involved outside of
                school, where students would participate in religious
                activities and sports.<a href="#fn12"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Even services such

                set up to help the community and keep people immersed in
                a culture of activism. Then, these organizations began
                to disappear. Much of this was due to an intense
                crackdown from the state.<a href="#fn14"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> But, part of it was
                due to a transition from in-person activist communities
                to online ones. In Graveyard of Clerics, Menoret
                recounts attending the meetings of a club formed by
                young activists who wanted to see change within the
                Muslim Brotherhood. These activists were challenging the
                hierarchy and norms of the organization, particularly by
                reading Western philosophy and literature, which the
                Brotherhood heavily discouraged. To develop this
                offshoot of the Brotherhood, the club members invited
                controversial lecturers and then engaged in intellectual
                discussions in the following Q&amp;A sessions. But, as
                Menoret attended these meetings, he saw their attendance
                decline and eventually the club ceased meeting entirely.
                Confused and disappointed, Menoret questioned one of the
                club members about why the club had stopped meeting. The
                member said that there was no point in hosting
                discussions anymore, as the internet was full of
                political discussion with more varied opinions.<a
                href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> The internet
                exposed young activists to more ideas, but they became
                less immersed in activist communities. They had
                sacrificed depth for breadth. Eventually, this
                influenced many activists to move on from the Awakening
                movement. Menoret interviewed another activist named
                Thamir, who had also slowly moved on from the Muslim
                Brotherhood. He wanted to continue to be an activist,
                but in a broader world of activism beyond just the
                Awakening. He found the idea of leaving his
                organization, meeting more activists, writing opinion
                pieces, and becoming visible on the Internet alluring.<a

                from the structured, rigid activism of the Muslim
                Brotherhood which had sustained the Sahwa for so long.
                Many young activists like Thamir stepped away from the
                original organizations of the Sahwa into the broader but
                more dangerous world of the internet.</p>
                <h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
                <p>Using the internet to communicate, spread ideas, and
                organize has harmed activists in Saudi Arabia. It is
                true that the internet has exposed activists to more
                ideas and increased their ability to express dissent and
                organize. In other states across the Middle East, this
                was central to the spread of the Arab Spring and the
                eventual toppling of the authoritarian regimes. However,
                in a state like Saudi Arabia where the government has
                enough wealth and power to tightly control the internet,
                the benefits of online activism are insufficient to
                overcome state repression. As a consequence of using the
                internet, the state is able to block online dissent and
                easily track the activities of dissidents. By
                transitioning from in person communities to online ones,
                young people are becoming less immersed and involved in
                activist movements. As long as activist communities
                primarily use the internet to radicalize and organize,
                prominent dissidents will be arrested and killed by the
                state and movements will slowly be starved of young
                supporters, all while failing to build enough momentum
                to overcome state repression.</p>
