                HYBRIDIZATION IN COLONIAL PERU</h1>
                <p>A central goal of the Spanish invasion of Peru was
                the complete conversion of the Indigenous people to
                Catholicism. To this end, the Spanish largely failed.
                Scholars such as José Carlos Mariátegui, Luis E.
                Valcárcel, and George Kubler have argued that the
                Spanish only succeeded in establishing a veneer of
                Catholicism, beneath which strong Indigenous practices
                and beliefs remained.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Given
                that Indigenous religious survival has been established
                by other historiography, this paper aims to investigate
                the methods by which Catholicism and Indigenous religion
                were able to coexist and hybridize in colonial Peru.
                These methods include Spanish concessions meant to make
                Catholicism more compatible with existing practices,
                Indigenous assimilation leading to hybrid forms of
                worship, and outright resistance to conversion.</p>
                <h2 id="spanish-adoption-of-indigenous-beliefs">SPANISH
                ADOPTION OF INDIGENOUS BELIEFS</h2>
                <p>To ease the process of converting Andeans, Spanish
                missionaries adopted Indigenous religious practices and
                ideas into their Catholic teachings. Early histories of
                Indigenous practices compiled by Spanish missionaries
                showed attempts to find common ground between the two
                religions. In Inca Religions and Customs, published in
                1653, Father Bernabe Cobo identified great overlap
                between Indigenous and Christian beliefs. Regarding
                native conceptions of the afterlife, Cobo described,
                “The Incas state that the souls of those who have been
                good go to heaven and enjoy perpetual bliss… They were
                also convinced that the inferno exists for bad people
                and that demons tormented them there.” This description
                of the afterlife is effectively the same as the
                Christian concepts of heaven and hell. Because of this,
                Cobo viewed the Indigenous religion as sharing Christian
                fundamentals, but also as being incomplete and deeply
                clouded by false practices. For example, he explained
                the lack of purgatory in the Indigenous understanding of
                the afterlife as a fact that was yet to be realized by
                the Andeans.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Another
                significant overlap was identified by Cobo as well as a
                different Spanish missionary, José de Acosta: that Dios
                existed among the many gods of the Andean pantheon,
                under the name of Viracocha.<a href="#fn3"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Cobo described
                Viracocha as the most important God and creator of all
                things, and his existence as proof of reason amid the
                Indian’s ignorance.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> These
                descriptions painted the Andeans as having always
                worshipped the Christian God, just among many other
                false gods. Such efforts to identify overlap show
                missionaries like Bernabe Cobo and Jose de Acosta
                believed their teachings were fundamentally compatible
                with the native religion. There was an existing
                foundation that Christianity could build upon. Thus,
                from the perspective of the missionaries, if the Indian
                religion shared several important concepts with
                Christianity, what would be the harm in temporarily
                borrowing other, less Christian concepts to ease the
                process of conversion? Spanish missionaries often did
                this — to extents ranging from slight adaptation to
                outright sacrilege.</p>
                <p>Many Catholic concessions took the form of language,
                where missionaries often conveyed more Indigenous
                understandings of religious concepts in Quechua
                translations. The Spanish introduced new words into
                Quechua to make distinct separations between Catholic
                and Indigenous religious actions. One example is
                confessacuni, meaning the action of confessing to a
                Catholic priest, versus ychucuni, meaning to confess to
                a hechizero (Indigenous priest). Another verb,
                mochacuni, distinctly meant the action of worshipping
                Huacas. However, missionaries did not always use the
                new, Catholic versions of these verbs. In Sin and
                Confession in Colonial Peru, Dr. Regina Harrison
                identified a case of a Catholic missionary using one
                such pagan verb in translation: “‘Domingocunapi
                fiestacunapipas çamacu[n]qui Diosta muchancapac’ (Rest
                on the holy days of Sunday and on feast days in order to
                worship God; my emphasis).”<a href="#fn5"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> This translation
                made conversion conceptually easier, as Andeans who
                heard these words would associate worship of the
                Christian God with worship of the Huacas, but it failed
                to make the distinction that complete conversion
                necessitated, and that the church had intended when it
                introduced new, Christian verbs. </p>
                <p>A step further in the concessions made by
                missionaries was applying Andean symbolism to Christian
                concepts. In Pastoral Quechua, Alan Durston identifies
                many words used in Quechua translations of Christian
                texts that had strong Indigenous connotations. The words
                capac and apu, meaning lord or king, were frequently
                applied to Jesus and God, or even to ideas such as the
                blood of Christ, to convey omnipotence. However, these
                words were strongly associated with the Sapa Inca, who
                also held divine status. The word usapu, meaning ‘he who
                can achieve anything’, was also used to translate the
                concept of omnipotence. This term was associated with
                Viracocha, the Incan god Cobo and de Acosta identified
                as Dios, although interestingly the missionary who made
                this translation believed another Indigenous god,
                Pachacamac, was the creator God. Finally, the stranger
                translations for omnipotence were words such as
                chacllipu, tocapu, and acnupu, which referred to the
                patterns embroidered on the clothes of the Sapa Inca.
                This conveyed the omnipotence of God through depicting
                him as dressed in the traditional clothes of powerful
                Incas.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> These translations
                show a transition from using words more familiar to the
                Incans to convey Christian concepts, to applying Andean
                symbolism to the concepts of Catholicism.</p>
                <p>A final, radical level of concessions made by the
                missionaries was the acceptance of Indigenous religious
                understandings and practices when they were unable to
                dispel them. An important concept the missionaries had
                long struggled to convey was the difference between
                representation and embodiment. To the Andeans, Huacas
                embodied Gods and took the form of physical places such
                as mountains and rock formations and objects such as
                stone idols. Thus, when the Spanish introduced images of
                Saints and crosses, they were unable to explain that the
                concepts these objects represented should be worshipped,
                not the objects themselves.<a href="#fn7"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Unable to dispel
                this misconception, the missionaries eventually leaned
                into it, and began to distribute Christian objects such
                as crosses, rosaries, statues, and amulets.<a
                href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> To speed up the
                process of conversion, the missionaries decided to
                supplant Indigenous religious objects with Christian
                ones. Effectively, they allowed the continued worship of
                Huacas—so long as those Huacas were Christian. This
                hybridization of Christian and Indigenous religious
                practices was not only facilitated by the missionaries,
                but rather was driven by the Andean converts, who
                adopted Christian beliefs along with their old ones and
                built a dual understanding of the world.</p>

                DEVELOPMENT OF ANDEO-CATHOLICISM</h2>
                <p>Indigenous Andeans assimilated Catholicism into their
                existing beliefs, leading to strongly hybrid religious
                practices. The compatibility of Indigenous and Christian
                religious beliefs was recognized not just by the
                Spanish, but by Indigenous religious leaders as well.
                “Religious specialists—the former camascas, amautas, and
                other wise men and women of Andean and Inca
                society—argued on substantial grounds that Catholicism
                was not so different from the Andean religion.”<a
                href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> This direction from
                the top of Andean religious society suggested that the
                “new” religion made sense in the context of the existing
                one. Christianity could be adopted into existing beliefs
                instead of outright replacing them. This perceived
                compatibility was in part due to familiarity with
                Christian concepts and practices. As discussed
                previously, the idea of venerating images of saints and
                other objects seemed the same as worshipping a Huaca.
                Further, in some cases, there was overlap between
                Christian and Andean iconography. One factor
                contributing to the popularity of Santiago Matamoros
                among the Andeans, beyond being the patron saint of
                expelling colonizers, was the apostle’s symbol of the
                seashell. Seashells, specifically the Pacific thorny
                oyster, were commonly sacrificed to Huacas.<a
                href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> This existing
                religious significance sped up the Indigenous adoption
                of St. James. Further, the preexisting significance of
                seashells manifested in unique, new world depictions of
                St. James. One such church painting depicts St. James
                baptizing Christ with a seashell, as seashells
                represented water to the Andeans.<a href="#fn11"

                multiple times. A 1753 rendition of the Last Supper by
                Marcos Zapata, an Andean Catholic, shows Jesus and the
                apostles<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"

                of the Last Supper that represent sacrifice. This is
                because Andeans commonly sacrificed cuy and chicha to
                Huacas, by burning the guinea pigs and pouring the
                chicha on the ground.<a href="#fn14"

                the missionaries. One missionary’s Quechua account of
                the crucifixion used language that implicitly compared

                <p>Much to the dismay of Spanish missionaries, many
                Andeans continued to worship God and the Huacas. In one
                such case, the kuraka and Catholic convert Don Diego
                Pacha decided to consult a hechizero when his son became
                gravely ill. This hechizero claimed that the boy’s
                illness was due to the ayllu’s neglect of a local Huaca.
                To try and correct this, the kuraka made an offering of
                chicha to the Huaca, to no immediate avail. When the
                hechizero claimed this offering was insufficient, and
                that more offerings must be made to other Huacas to heal
                the boy, Don Diego became upset and denounced the
                hechizero to the local Catholic priest. He then donated
                20 reales to the church, asking that a mass be held for
                the recovery of his son.<a href="#fn16"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> This shows the
                Indigenous and Catholic religions as two distinct yet
                coexisting options that were practiced and utilized as
                Indigenous people saw fit. However, these practices did
                not only exist in separate worlds. Andeans often
                worshipped Huacas and God simultaneously. In one
                example, the Augustinian Juan Ramiro had been hearing
                about the ongoing worship of a Huaca, Guamansiri, for
                months among his converts. Unable to find this Huaca, he
                was finally able to get an Andean man to reveal its
                whereabouts. He was horrified to discover that
                Guamansiri took the form of a small weaving that had
                been hidden behind the church’s altar. The Andeans had
                been worshipping the Huaca during mass.<a href="#fn17"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> To many Andeans,
                churches were not just for Christian worship. Previous
                forms of worship continued in these spaces as well. This
                broke down the distinction between Catholicism and
                Indigenous practices, and led to the formation of a
                single, hybrid religion. Many missionaries claimed that
                they had fully uprooted paganism, but in reality the
                practice continued, often because the Indigenous people
                had hidden their Huaca worship quite adeptly, or because
                the two religions had blended inseparably. Ultimately,
                this was something that the Spanish failed to control,
                and the hybridization of the two belief systems became
                entrenched. However, not all Andeans accepted
                Christianity as something that could be harmlessly
                adopted. Many rightfully saw Christianity as the scourge
                of their communities and rejected it in favor of
                practicing a purer form of their old beliefs. </p>

                <p>Many Andeans resisted conversion to Catholicism or
                even rebelled against it by attempting to revive
                Indigenous religion. Certain actions taken by Indigenous
                people showed a clear preference for the existing
                religion over the intruding one. As discussed earlier,
                some missionaries distributed Catholic objects to uproot
                the worship of Indigenous Huacas. These Catholic objects
                were not always received as equals to existing Huacas.
                Missionary accounts show many instances of people
                sacrificing items like rosaries and images of saints to
                their Huacas.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> This
                drew a clear distinction between Catholic religious
                objects and Indigenous ones. People who made these
                sacrifices considered the Catholic objects powerful
                enough to be worth sacrificing, but less powerful than
                the existing Huacas. These individual actions against
                Catholicism showed some preference for the old religion.
                A more substantive example is mass, organized
                rebellion. </p>
                <p>In the 1560s, early in the colonial order, a
                religious revival movement formed in the Andes. It was
                called the Taki Onqoy, or “dancing sickness,” because it
                was believed that neglected Huacas possessed preachers
                and made them dance as they delivered divine will. These
                dancers preached the return of the Huacas, the downfall
                of the Christian God, and the extirpation of the
                recently arrived Spanish. The rebellion spread widely
                throughout the provinces.<a href="#fn19"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> This movement was
                both a religious and political revolt. It identified
                both the Christian God and the Spanish as the cause of
                Andean suffering and proposed a solution of returning to
                the pre-Spanish status-quo of Huaca worship and Incan
                kings. Obviously, this was quite alarming to the
                Spanish. The viceroy, Francisco de Toledo, sent a
                visitador general to crush the uprising.  The leaders of
                the rebellion were identified and punished, which
                effectively ended the movement within a few years. No
                similar movement would arise afterwards.<a href="#fn20"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> To make matters
                worse, the Spanish killed the last Incan king, Túpac
                Amaru, shortly afterwards, crushing the hopes of a
                return to Incan dominance. The fact that no similar
                revival movements followed does not mean that Andeans
                submitted to Catholicism. As discussed earlier, this
                period was filled with cases of individual acts of
                resistance, coexistence of Indigenous and Catholic
                religious practices, and the formation of a hybrid
                Andeo-Catholicism built on the concepts and symbols of
                both religions. Instead, it is likely that the Taki
                Onqoy rebellion taught the Andeans to never neglect the
                Huacas, and that this lesson drove the long-lasting
                practice of Huaca-worship, which survived even as
                Catholicism continued to spread in the Andes.</p>
                <h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
                <p>Both the Spanish missionaries and Andeans drove
                religious hybridization in colonial Peru. The Spanish
                contributed to this process by adopting Indigenous
                religious concepts and practices into their teachings.
                This made Catholicism more compatible with Indigenous
                religion and sped up the process of converting the
                Andeans, although to a less “pure” version of
                Catholicism. Andeans contributed to this process by
                assimilating Christianity into their existing beliefs,
                which came in the form of applying Indigenous meaning
                and symbolism to Christianity, as well as continuing the
                practices of both religions, either distinctly or
                simultaneously. Finally, many Andeans kept Indigenous
                religion alive by resisting conversion, using methods
                ranging from individual acts of rejection to widespread
                rebellion. Although outright rebellion was not frequent
                throughout the colonial era, it was enough to establish
                the importance of the continued worship of Huacas.
                Overall, these actions resulted in the practice of a
                deeply hybrid Andeo-Catholicism in colonial Peru. </p>
