## PROJECT SUMMARY
In 1950, the California Highways and Public Works department published the centennial edition of its official journal. On this 100th anniversary of the state’s admission to the union, the CHPW intended to celebrate the great progress achieved through the construction of highways, and to frame this progress as a historical trend that had been long in the making—-well before the era of automobiles. The purpose of this journal is best summarized by its foreword, a short note located adjacent to a portrait of Junipero Serra, as well as pictures of nine of the senior directors of the California Highway Commission: 

> In the chapters written by Alice Fisher Simpson and Stewart Mitchell is unfolded the story of California’s first famous Emigrant Trails and the people who blazed them: The trails of the early explorers in the service of His Majesty, the King of Spain; the immortal Padres intent on planting the cross of Christendom among the heathen children of the wilderness; the fur traders and the mountain men, restless and adventurous; the white-covered wagons of the emigrant trains, answering the call of “Gold!” It is the colorful epic of stagecoach days, when the sturdy Concords, rocking and swaying, rumbled over the narrow, twisted roads of the ‘60’s and ’70’s; the mule-teams and the cumbersome freighters—whose glory was dimmed by the coming of the “Iron Horse.”

> Today, many of these famous old trails have become important U.S. and state highways, over which the motorist may travel with ease and comfort—basking in the romance of yesterday, and reliving the dynamic events of California’s glorious past.[^1] 

Clearly, the historical perspective presented by this document is antiquated. Today, many members of the public are conscious of the devastating effects that the mission system, the gold rush, and American emigration had on the indigenous people of California. It is common to view people like Serra as nuanced and controversial historical figures, who should not necessarily be glorified. In this context, it may seem shortsighted for California’s Highway Commission to have equated themselves with some of the most problematic and destructive trends in California’s history. However, I argue that this is an apt comparison. California’s highways, and suburban development more broadly, subjugated lower-class workers and people of color. The state actively opposed existing, more equitable systems in order to pursue decentralized development.  Thus, I propose the creation of a foil report—a counter to the perspective presented by CHPW’s centennial edition publication. This report would highlight the devastating effects of suburban and car dependent development, situate this trend as another destructive force in California’s history of conquest and colonization, and pinpoint California as the origin of this national pattern of development.
