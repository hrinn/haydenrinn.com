                <h2 id="project-summary">PROJECT SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>In 1950, the California Highways and Public Works
                department published the centennial edition of its
                official journal. On this 100th anniversary of the
                state’s admission to the union, the CHPW intended to
                celebrate the great progress achieved through the
                construction of highways, and to frame this progress as
                a historical trend that had been long in the making —
                well before the era of automobiles. The purpose of this
                journal is best summarized by its foreword, a short note
                located adjacent to a portrait of Junipero Serra, as
                well as pictures of nine of the senior directors of the
                California Highway Commission:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>In the chapters written by Alice Fisher Simpson and
                Stewart Mitchell is unfolded the story of California’s
                first famous Emigrant Trails and the people who blazed
                them: The trails of the early explorers in the service
                of His Majesty, the King of Spain; the immortal Padres
                intent on planting the cross of Christendom among the
                heathen children of the wilderness; the fur traders and
                the mountain men, restless and adventurous; the
                white-covered wagons of the emigrant trains, answering
                the call of “Gold!” It is the colorful epic of
                stagecoach days, when the sturdy Concords, rocking and
                swaying, rumbled over the narrow, twisted roads of the
                ’60’s and ’70’s; the mule-teams and the cumbersome
                freighters—whose glory was dimmed by the coming of the
                “Iron Horse.”</p>
                <p>Today, many of these famous old trails have become
                important U.S. and state highways, over which the
                motorist may travel with ease and comfort—basking in the
                romance of yesterday, and reliving the dynamic events of
                California’s glorious past.<a href="#fn1"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Clearly, the historical perspective presented by this
                document is antiquated. Today, many members of the
                public are conscious of the devastating effects that the
                mission system, the gold rush, and American emigration
                had on the indigenous people of California. It is common
                to view people like Serra as nuanced and controversial
                historical figures, who should not necessarily be
                glorified. In this context, it may seem shortsighted for
                California’s Highway Commission to have equated
                themselves with some of the most problematic and
                destructive trends in California’s history. However, I
                argue that this is an apt comparison. California’s
                highways, and suburban development more broadly,
                subjugated lower-class workers and people of color. The
                state actively opposed existing, more equitable systems
                in order to pursue decentralized development. Thus, I
                propose the creation of a foil report — a counter to the
                perspective presented by CHPW’s centennial edition
                publication. This report would highlight the devastating
                effects of suburban and car dependent development,
                situate this trend as another destructive force in
                California’s history of conquest and colonization, and
                pinpoint California as the origin of this national
                pattern of development.</p>
                <h2 id="public-learning-objectives">PUBLIC LEARNING
                OBJECTIVES</h2>
                <p>The objective of this project is to address a
                disconnect in public historical thinking—namely, a
                tendency to hold a critical perspective on much of
                California’s history, but to blindly accept suburban
                development as progress, or even serve to reinforce it.
                This tendency is due to a lack of awareness of the
                negative effects of suburban development. This project
                seeks to help the public understand how suburban
                development in Los Angeles and California led to the
                suppression of the labor movement, uneven development
                between white and non-white communities, and the
                intentional destruction of ethnically diverse
                neighborhoods through the construction of highways. This
                development was not inevitable, rather, it was
                intentionally pursued at the expense of a different
                path: healthier, diverse, and more equitable cities
                supported by accessible public transit. Through an
                understanding of this history, members of the public
                will build a critical perspective on suburban
                development and, if the project is successful, decide to
                actively oppose the system’s continuation.</p>
                <h2 id="audience-identification">AUDIENCE
                IDENTIFICATION</h2>
                <p>The tendency to ignore and reinforce the negative
                aspects of suburban development is noticeable and most
                hypocritical among a particular demographic: liberal
                Californians. This can be seen in the statewide battle
                over zoning laws. Single-family residential zoning laws
                were essential to the creation of the suburbs and
                currently serve to maintain them. Single-family zoning
                mandates that only detached houses occupied by one
                family can be constructed—the lowest density and least
                affordable residential zoning. The Los Angeles City
                Planning Commission created the first modern zoning
                system in the 1910’s, which included the first
                single-family zoning law. Residential, commercial, and
                industrial zoning ensured “segregation of use”.
                Single-family zoning ensured “segregation of
                population.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The
                minority groups of Los Angeles, poorer than much of the
                white population, would not be able to afford a detached
                home in these newly zoned neighborhoods. The commission
                created this law to reinforce the existing racial
                divisions of Los Angeles.</p>
                <p>Today, the situation has not improved much.
                Seventy-eight percent of residential land in greater Los
                Angeles is still single-family zoned.<a href="#fn3"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> In a strongly
                liberal city, especially one with a housing crisis, this
                makes no sense, as single-family zoning is a direct
                obstacle to the construction of affordable housing. This
                problem still exists because, time and time again,
                Californians have fought attempts to rezone their
                neighborhoods. In 2013, the residents of Palo Alto voted
                to overturn a resolution that rezoned a small lot to
                allow for the construction of 60 affordable housing
                units intended for low-income senior citizens. The
                primary complaint of the Palo Alto residents was that
                the development would be “out of scale” with the
                surrounding neighborhood.<a href="#fn4"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The residents of a
                city who voted 66% Democrat in the 2012 and 2016

                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> rallied to reject an
                affordable housing initiative to preserve the aesthetic
                of their low-density neighborhood. Many liberal
                Californians have a fundamental disconnect between
                belief and action when it comes to affordable housing.
                They support initiatives at the ballot box, but they
                refuse to make real changes to their suburban
                communities. Therefore, they are a suitable target
                audience for this project. Californians who are
                politically invested enough to organize against rezoning
                initiatives are more likely to be receptive to a long
                form, written report related to the issue. Through
                understanding why the neighborhoods they live in were
                constructed, and how this development came at the
                expense of many other Californians of lesser means, the
                liberal occupants of suburbia would be encouraged to
                critically analyze their own surroundings.</p>
                <h2 id="resource-planning">RESOURCE PLANNING</h2>
                <p>To mirror the length of the CHPW’s journal, the
                counter report would require historical research beyond
                the scope of this proposal. The arguments of this
                proposal, which are explored briefly below, contain
                historical analysis through the lens of class and race,
                and are supported by historiography. But this basis is
                nowhere near enough to rival the original 172-page
                journal. Additionally, the original journal contains art
                and photography related to its contents. The proposed
                journal would contain the artwork of Californians who
                have resisted suburban and highway development, as
                explored by the scholar Eric Avila.<a href="#fn6"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> This includes the
                work of Carlos Almaraz, a notable artist in the Chicano
                Movement. Many of his works are focused on highways,
                which also dominate the neighborhood where he grew
                up—East L.A.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>In “Crash in Phthalo Green,” Almaraz depicts the
                violence that highways bring to the communities they
                pass through, namely horrific car crashes. This painting
                also emphasizes how ingrained highways are in
                communities like East L.A. They are a permanent part of
                the landscape—-in this piece the highway nearly blends
                in with the sky. Another artist whose work depicts the
                consequences of highway development is Judith Baca. Her
                half mile long mural entitled “The Great Wall of Los
                Angeles,” is painted on a concrete wall of the Los
                Angeles river. The mural depicts a chronological history
                of Los Angeles from the perspective of oppressed
                peoples.</p>

                <p>In this section of the mural, Baca shows how suburban
                development has invaded the communities of East L.A. A
                writhing tentacle of highway has crashed through homes
                and pulled a family apart. Dodger Stadium looms on right
                side of the mural, like an alien spaceship. Many of the
                residents of the Chavez Ravine neighborhood were
                uprooted to build the stadium. The imagery of this
                section depicts suburban development as an invading
                alien force, removing the people who many Americans call
                aliens. Works such as these would enhance the proposal,
                and funding would be required to license existing art or
                commission new work. Finally, to distribute many copies
                of this report, large scale printing would be
                required.</p>
                <h2 id="contributions-to-public-discourse">CONTRIBUTIONS
                TO PUBLIC DISCOURSE</h2>
                <p>This project contributes research and historical
                analysis to the nuanced issue of suburban development,
                in order to bring this conversation into the domain of
                public memory. Suburbanization weakened the labor
                movement, trapped non-white Californians in poverty, and
                destroyed existing diverse neighborhoods. Through an
                awareness of these harmful historical effects, the
                target audience will hopefully reconsider their position
                on the issue.</p>
                <p>Decentralized industrialization in Los Angeles
                separated workers from the labor movement. As industry
                poured into L.A. in the 1920s, large factory-cities were
                established in the periphery. The Chamber of Commerce
                encouraged this pattern of development, as it led to
                “contented” workers living in individual houses around
                the factories.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
                Conveniently, these workers were kept away from the
                labor movement that was concentrated among traditional
                industry downtown, and as a result, were significantly
                less likely to unionize. </p>
                <p>White flight, motivated by fomented racist attitudes,
                caused the uneven development of suburban, white
                communities at the expense of inner-city, non-white
                communities. Although white flight began after WWII, the
                effort to associate minorities with urban areas began
                earlier. In 1926, during a fight against a referendum to
                approve public transit running on elevated tracks, the
                L.A. Times contended that elevated trains would bring
                filth, gloom, and darkness.<a href="#fn8"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Beyond referencing
                the direct obfuscation of light by the raised tracks,
                ‘darkening’ the city had racial undertones, which the
                L.A. times played upon to successfully rally white
                residents against the referendum. By the time white
                flight began in full, there was a direct association
                between inner-cities and Black people. Racism motivated
                white flight, but it was encouraged by federal policy
                meant to incentivize suburban construction, specifically
                by the Homeowners Loan Corporation, the Federal Housing
                Administration, and the Veterans Administration.<a
                href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The resulting racial
                segregation, where whites acquired homes in the suburbs
                and non-whites remained in declining cities, was the
                most significant force for uneven development in modern
                America.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"

                <p>Los Angeles’ city planners wielded development to
                destroy ethnically diverse neighborhoods. Boyle Heights
                is an L.A. neighborhood that was previously one of the
                most diverse in the city. As a result of redlining, it
                became one of the city’s most notable and concentrated
                Latino communities. In a 1939 city survey, an official
                for L.A.’s Homeowner’s Loan Corporation noted that Boyle
                Heights, “seems ripe for some type of slum clearance
                project.”<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"

                <p>This path of suburbanization was a pivot from the way
                Los Angeles was heading, which was centralization,
                robust public transportation, and decreasing racial
                tensions. The city’s planners chose decentralization.
                Their motives for this were plain—they believed
                centralized cities brought crime, poverty, and racial
                mixing.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Instead of healthy,
                diverse neighborhoods like early Boyle Heights, the
                planners wanted segregation. To achieve this, the
                existing mode had to be destroyed. In the early 1900s,
                L.A. was home to an extensive transit system of electric
                street cars.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
                However, the nature of the streetcar system began to
                shift from urban to inter-urban, at the direction of the
                city’s planners. Extending far to connect peripheral
                cities, the streetcar system began to facilitate
                decentralized development.<a href="#fn14"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Eventually, in the
                interest of the automotive industry, the streetcar was
                replaced by the freeway.<a href="#fn15"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>  </p>
                <p>These historical trends are just a few examples of
                the tangible, destructive results of suburban
                development. This project matters because these
                consequences are still felt by many Californians, and
                the problem cannot be adequately addressed as long as it
                is ignored.</p>
                <h2 id="methods-of-public-engagement">METHODS OF PUBLIC
                ENGAGEMENT</h2>
                <p>Through learning about the above issues, the target
                audience would understand suburban development as a
                system of oppression. It weakened the labor movement (a
                cause most liberals should support), segregated the
                country, and plunged many non-white Californians into
                poverty through implicit and explicit destruction of
                their neighborhoods. These harmful effects would force
                the target audience to reckon with their position on
                suburban development, and hopefully convince them to
                stop hypocritically perpetuating the system.</p>
                <p>The juxtaposition between the original and proposed
                journals would further engage the public. The original
                journal covers topics that a large share of the target
                audience already understands as oppressive. Framing
                suburbanization in this context enables the public to
                understand it as another force in California’s history
                of conquest.</p>
                <p>Finally, by learning about the more equitable model
                for a city that once was, the target audience will be
                encouraged to picture it as a model that can be revived.
                The proposed document focuses on the historical designs
                and outcomes of suburban development. This issue is
                still a plague on Californian and American cities, with
                patterns of reinforcement and consequences that have
                evolved since. This is where the target audience can
                continue to learn — to understand where suburban
                development has left us and what can be done about
                it.</p>
