                </p>
                <p>“Fishbone Hair” is a poem by Kathy Jetñil-Kijiner, a
                Marshallese poet, about her niece Bianca Lanki who died
                of leukemia when she was eight years old. Bianca is one
                of the many Marshallese people who have succumbed to
                cancer and other illnesses caused by radiation. This
                radiation is part of the painful and destructive legacy
                of U.S. nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands. The
                most destructive test, Operation Castle Bravo, was
                conducted on March 1, 1954 when the U.S. military
                detonated a 15 megaton nuclear bomb. The outcome was a
                disaster. Following the blast, Rongelap atoll as well as
                two other nearby atolls were blanketed in radioactive
                fallout. The U.S. claimed that this was an accident,
                caused by the unexpectedly high yield of the bomb which
                was two and a half times larger than what was
                calculated, as well as adverse wind conditions. After
                spending 48 hours in the fallout, where children played
                in the radioactive ash they thought was snow, the people
                who lived on Rongelap atoll were evacuated on March 3.<a
                href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> They spent three
                years living on U.S. military bases and small islands
                before being returned to Rongelap in 1957 and told it
                was safe.</p>
                <p>In 2012, many decades after Castle Bravo irreversibly
                changed the lives of the Rongelap people, the U.S.
                government stated that the Rongelap people had been
                adequately compensated and that no further aid was
                owed.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In reality, the
                United States abandoned the Rongelap people after
                returning them to their irradiated home in 1957, and
                left them to fight for help alone ever since. </p>
                <p>This paper fits into a broader field of
                historiography called Global Hibakusha. Hibakusha is a
                Japanese term that translates to ‘explosion-affected
                person’ and refers to the survivors of Hiroshima and
                Nagasaki. While Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the most
                well-known nuclear events, nuclear weapons have been
                detonated thousands of times around the world, killing
                many and leaving survivors dealing with long-term
                consequences. Global Hibakusha aims to bring attention
                to these often-forgotten victims. It also aims to link
                distant Hibakusha communities and build a more cohesive
                history of the social impacts of nuclear testing.<a

                role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> We can build a
                stronger understanding of the terrible consequences of
                nuclear weapons by telling the story of the Rongelap
                people, whose struggle as a result of radiation and
                fight for justice is unknown to many.</p>
                <h2 id="the-u.s.-cover-up">THE U.S. COVER-UP</h2>
                <p>The United States has tried to avoid responsibility
                for Castle Bravo and never fulfilled its obligation to
                help the people whose lives were destroyed by its
                fallout. The U.S. obligation to help the Rongelapese
                people is clear. Even if the disaster was an accident,
                coming to someone elses home to test dangerous and
                poorly-understood weapons is unacceptable. Worse, some
                scholars do not believe that Castle Bravo was an
                accident. A Global Hibakusha article written by
                Dr. Seiichiro Takemine presents evidence from U.S.
                government reports that the wind and high yield may not
                have been as unexpected as the U.S. claimed in 1954. In
                particular, the military knew that the wind conditions
                did not match the predictions 13 hours ahead of the
                test. Additionally, months before the Bravo test,
                scientists calculated possible fallout radii in order to
                safely position military personnel. One of these
                estimates was made for a 20 Megaton yield. The actual
                yield of Operation Bravo was 15 Megatons.<a href="#fn4"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The 15 Megaton yield
                may have not matched the final calculations, but it was
                not outside the range of reasonable expectations. This
                evidence shows that the consequences of Castle Bravo can
                not be dismissed as an accident and instead reflect a
                U.S. disregard of native peoples. Further, this makes it
                completely unacceptable that the U.S. has neither
                accepted responsibility for these events nor fully
                helped and compensated the victims.</p>
                <p>Evidence of this U.S. stance began early. On March 3,
                1954, the U.S. evacuated the Rongelapese and brought
                them to a Naval base on Kwajalein Atoll. Here, they were
                treated for severe radiation injuries. When it became
                clear that Rongelap would not be safe to return to for
                some time, the people were moved to a temporary
                settlement on Ejit. These events were recounted in a
                series of articles called <em>Modern Atomic Exiles</em>
                published in the Honolulu Advertiser 4 months after the
                Bravo shot. The author, S. H. Riesenberg, was an
                anthropologist who worked for the U.S. Trust Territory
                that controlled Micronesia at the time. His words
                demonstrate a reluctance to blame the U.S. First,
                besides a short preamble that says the nuclear test had
                “unexpected results,” the author does not acknowledge
                that the U.S. was at fault.<a href="#fn5"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Instead, the article
                focuses on how much the U.S. had helped the people of
                Rongelap since the blast. Second, the article mostly
                ignores the perspectives of the Rongelap people, except
                when it benefits the U.S. image. Riesenberg describes
                the Rongelap people as excited to be on the Navy base
                seeing movies and watching planes land—while in reality
                many of them were suffering from radiation poisoning.<a
                href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Later, when the
                Rongelap people were living in their temporary
                settlement, Riesenberg described them as “well settled,”
                even though Ejit island lacked the resources to support
                them and they were surviving on rations.<a href="#fn7"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The article mostly
                focuses on the Utirik people, who were also evacuated
                after Bravo, but were further from the blast than the
                Rongelapese and thus received less radiation. Such a
                presentation of events demonstrates an attempt to
                minimize U.S. responsibility. In the article, Riesenberg
                estimates that the Rongelapese would be able to return
                home in a few months.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> It ended
                up taking three years, during which time, the U.S.
                actively assisted the Rongelapese. After returning them
                home, U.S. assistance abruptly stopped, even though many
                signs showed the radiation remained.</p>
                <p>Since returning home in 1957, the Rongelap people
                have been met with resistance, misinformation, and
                indifference from the U.S. government while facing
                severe, radiation-related health issues. John Anjain,
                the leader of the Rongelap people when the Bravo test
                occurred, was promised by the U.N. Trusteeship
                Council,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> as well as U.S.
                government officials, that only an insignificant and
                non-dangerous amount of radiation persisted on the
                atoll.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> This reassurance
                was enough for the Rongelapese to return home. They were
                hoping that they could return to their previous lives
                and put the illness and misery they experienced over the
                previous three years behind them. This was not the case.
                Death and radiation-related health issues continued.
                Kiosang Kios was 15 years old when Operation Bravo
                occurred and received a high dose of radiation that
                caused burns and made her hair fall out. These immediate
                effects were just the beginning, as Kiosang would suffer
                lifelong consequences from the radiation. Beginning in
                1957, Kiosang began to have many issues giving birth.
                She gave birth to a baby that had no bones and malformed
                skin, who died within a day. She then had several more
                stillbirths and miscarriages, and ultimately gave birth
                to a child who had thyroid problems and severe issues
                with her legs.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> In
                addition to the pain of losing a child, miscarriages
                carried additional shame for Marshallese women. This is
                described in the poem <em>Monster</em> by Kathy
                Jetñil-Kijiner, which is about the women like Kiosang
                who gave birth to deformed babies. These women buried
                their stillborn babies and hid miscarriages to avoid the
                shame from their families. According to Jetñil-Kijiner,
                in Marshallese culture it is believed that women who
                have miscarriages have been unfaithful to their
                husbands.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
                Mothers hid miscarriages from their husbands because
                they did not want to be accused of being unfaithful.
                This likely contributed to subsequent medical studies
                underestimating the rates of miscarriages and birth
                deformities. The poem also brings up a monster in
                Marshallese culture, the Mejenkwaad, a mother who turns
                into a demon that eats her own babies. Stories like
                these could have been a way that Rongelapese women
                understood the unexplainable horrors they were
                experiencing in childbirth. Jetñil-Kijiner wonders, did
                they consider themselves monsters?<a href="#fn13"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> These fears and
                health issues were widespread upon the return to the
                atoll and caused the Rongelap people to question if U.S.
                had told the truth when they were promised the atoll was
                safe.  </p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the U.S. continued the reassure the
                Rongelap people that they were not in danger from
                radiation.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
                Acknowledging that the atoll was not safe would have
                meant admitting the situation was worse than what had
                been shared with the public. It appears the U.S.
                government cared more about protecting itself than
                helping the Rongelap people, as is evidenced by how the
                U.S. continued to publicly portray Bravo.</p>
                <p>In the 1960s, the Honolulu Advertiser printed stories
                claiming that everything was well on Rongelap. The
                article <em>‘Fallout Children’ Show No Evidence of
                Defects</em> claimed that despite high rates of thyroid
                problems among Rongelap children, most cases were
                benign. The article also claimed that infant mortality
                and birth defect rates on Rongelap were completely
                normal.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Some articles went
                even further in misrepresenting the situation on
                Rongelap. <em>’54 Bikini Blast Boon to Victims</em>
                reported that not only were the Rongelap people
                completely free of radiation, miscarriages, and deformed
                babies by 1962, but that they were now prospering. The
                article says that the Rongelap people “never had it so
                good,” and that they were the “richest in the Territory”

                of Energy published a radiological survey that had been
                conducted in 1978 which had determined that parts of
                Rongelap atoll were as contaminated as Bikini atoll.<a

                Marshall Islands that threatened the Rongelap people:
                The Compact of Free Association (COFA). COFA, which
                began being drafted in 1980, aimed to bring a degree of
                sovereignty to some Micronesian states, including the
                Republic of the Marshall Islands. COFA granted economic
                assistance for the Micronesian states in exchange for
                continued military usage for the U.S., among other
                provisions.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref"

                into specific sections of COFA. Aisen Tima, a Rongelap
                man who was 5 months old when Bravo occurred, voiced his
                concerns with COFA in an interview from 1985. He said
                that Section 177, which focused on economic aid for
                nuclear victims, had a clause that would prevent the
                Rongelap people from bringing their claims to U.S.
                courts. Aisen was concerned that his two young daughters
                would have medical issues in the future, like many
                Rongelapese children, and that he would be left without
                recourse if Section 177 were passed.<a href="#fn27"

                himself and his community from policies like Section
                177. This led to widespread political involvement among
                the Rongelapese, who would go on to lobby governments,
                testify at hearings, and give speeches to fight for
                their home and their safety. COFA was passed via
                plebiscite with Section 177 unchanged, but the people of
                Rongelap continued to fight. Rongelapese representatives

                <p>After the evacuation of Rongelap, an accurate

                surveys had been conducted by the same organizations
                that would be held responsible if Rongelap was found to
                be contaminated. An independent survey was needed in
                order to get the unbiased truth. This is what the
                Rongelap people asked for when they went to Congress yet
                again to try and help their people in 1989.<a

                stories of what radiation had done to them and about how
                desperately they want to safely return home. A study
                that was fully independent from the U.S. was never
                conducted. However, a separate Committee was setup that
                oversaw radiological assessments for the Marshall
                Islands. In 1994, a study found that Rongelap would not

                residents of Rongelap raised multiple concerns about the
                funding. First, the $40 million dollars would be barely
                enough to cover the process, as it involved removing the
                topsoil and replacing it with crushed coral, as well as
                new construction and other expensive operations. Second,
                the funding did not cover cleanup for smaller islands
                within the atoll, which were not traditionally inhabited
                but stilled used to gather food and grow copra. Finally,
                if further sources of radiation were found or radiation
                safety standards change, the funding would not be
                appropriately adjusted.<a href="#fn33"

                LASTING IMPACTS OF NUCLEAR TESTING</h2>
                <p>The cultural impacts of nuclear testing in Rongelap
                have been severe but are much harder to quantify than
                issues like cancer rates and radiation levels. One way
                these cultural impacts can be explored is through
                cultural works like poetry. A theme in Kathy
                Jetñil-Kijiner’s poetry is how nuclear testing has hurt
                the Marshallese language. In the poem <em>On the Couch
                with Būbu Nein</em>, Jetñil-Kijiner recounts struggling
                to communicate with her grandmother. Her grandmother had
                tongue cancer and could no longer speak her native and
                only language of Marshallese. Jetñil-Kijiner, in return,
                struggled to speak Marshallese to her grandmother, as
                she was ashamed of her accent which sounded English from
                living in Hawai’i.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> In the
                grandmother’s case, radiation had directly taken her
                ability to talk, and she could no longer share stories
                with her granddaughter. In Jetñil-Kijiner’s case, she
                had been forced by radiation to move at a young age to a
                safer place to live, taking her away from her native
                language. This theme exists in other poems, like in
                <em>Bursts of Bianca</em>, which is about
                Jetñil-Kijiner’s niece who died of leukemia.
                Jetñil-Kijiner observes that Bianca, like many
                Marshallese, is fluent in the language of cancer. She
                knows terms like blood cells, bone marrow, catheter, and
                remission therapy despite knowing little other
                English.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref"

                the people of Rongelap. This legacy was explored in a

                stated that nuclear testing has turned many people of
                the Marshall Islands into, “nomads who are disconnected

                <p>The U.N. report also gave final, direct
                recommendations to the U.S. to fully compensate
                Marshallese individuals from the nuclear claims fund,
                and that a presidential acknowledgment and apology
                should be issued for the damages caused by nuclear
                testing.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> The
                U.S. responded to these recommendations shortly after
                the U.N. report was published:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>The United States acknowledges the negative effects
                of our nuclear testing program and has accepted, and
                acted on, our responsibility to the people of the
                Marshall Islands. As part of the 1986 Compact of Free
                Association, the United States and the Marshall Islands
                agreed to a “full and final settlement” of all claims
                related to the nuclear testing.<a href="#fn41"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Beyond this statement, no presidential acknowledgment
                or apology was ever issued. As long as today’s victims
                of nuclear testing continue to die from radiation-caused
                cancers and parts of the Marshall Islands like Rongelap
                are too contaminated to safely return to, the United
                States has completely failed in its responsibility to
                the people of the Marshall Islands. The U.S. is
                responsible not just for the effects of its nuclear
                testing, but for the insidious cover-up attempt which
                led to the Rongelapese living in unsafe radiation for
                decades. No settlement can begin address the suffering
                this caused.</p>
                <p>While the U.S. continues to avoid its full
                responsibility, hope lies in the long fight for justice
                by the Rongelapese. All progress won so far was hard
                fought for—through petitions for aid and compensation in
                the U.S. Congress, in the self-organized evacuation of
                the atoll of 1985, in legal self-defense against
                policies like Section 177 of COFA, and through the
                efforts to convince the U.S. to finally begin a cleanup
                of their home. This fight is far from over, and must be
                aided by raising awareness about an issue that few know
                enough about. Through such efforts, we may begin to
                fully understand the long-lasting consequences that
                nuclear weapons have wrought upon the world and help the
                many victims that have been left in their fallout.</p>
